# react-ts-boiler
A basic boiler with React using TypeScript. This uses pnpm, Babel, Webpack and the webpack-dev-server.

## Initial Setup
Pretty simple - clone the repo, rename the directory (should you choose to), install the modules, start the server and start coding!
1. Clone the repo:  `gh repo clone KevinGenus/react-ts-boiler`
1. Rename the repo:  `mv react-ts-boiler your-directory`
1. Install node-modules: `cd your-directory && pnpm install`
1. Start the server: `pnpm start`
